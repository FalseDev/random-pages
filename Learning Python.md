# [RealPython](https://realpython.com)
Real Python is a website to improve your python skills in byte sized content that can even be received as a newsletter every week.

The site has a lot of good tutorials.

# [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com)
HackerRank can be used to test your knowledge against challenges, and also learn by competing.

# [GoalKicker](https://goalkicker.com/PythonBook/)
This is an excellent resource for intermediate level developers who want to learn more about the features of the Python language and standard library.

It is presented as a lump of information in a standard textbook format, so it's not suitable for the easily bored.

# [Python docs](https://docs.python.org)
The official Python documentation includes information about the builtins, core datatypes, standard library, and some inner workings of Python.

It is suitable as a reference but also contains a tutorial on the language itself [here](https://doc.python.org/3/tutorial)
